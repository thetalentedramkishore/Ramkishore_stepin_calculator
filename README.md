Introduction





Scientific calculators are used widely in situations that require quick access to certain mathematical functions,especially those that were once looked up in mathematical tables,such as trigonometric functions or logarithms.A scientific calculator is a calculator designed to help you calculate science,engineering and mathematics problems.
In this project we will be implementing the some operation like Arthimetic operations,Trignometric operations and some essential operations using C language.

History of Calculator



The importance of this helpful tool was known in the early times. At that time, early men use bones, pebbles and other objects to tally the calculations. But, it was very limited in nature. So, when the first mainframe computers came into existence. It was using vacuum tubes and transistors. That leads to stepping stones to develop an electronic calculator. Therefore, the first electronic calculator was launched by Casio computer company in 1957. followed by a series of models with compact technology. Some leading manufactures opted for this technology to cover this new market. Like Canon, Sony, Toshiba, Olivetti, etc. In the mid-’60s to the ’70s, there was the time of programmable calculators. Those were heavy desktop machines with the large needs of AC power supply. Then, there comes a time in the ’70s. The revolution in calculator manufacturing. Companies started manufacturing pocket calculators. Moreover, it has great size and less need of power to solve the problem. The cost of these calculators is also very less. Afterward, the innovations and updates in this device industry are still continuing. Meanwhile, manufacturers are putting all their efforts and research and development techniques to improve the technology for multi-purposes.

Advantages



Calculator can solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner.

Computations done via calculators are more accurate to the ones done by humans.



Disadvantges


Calculator limits the knowledge of users.

Calculators can aid a lot in cheating.
